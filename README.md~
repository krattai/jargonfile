jargonfile
==========

This will be the authoritative repository for the jargon file. Eric S. Raymond is no longer the maintainer of the jargon file and in the spirit of hackers everywhere, this git repository was created. 

# Why is Eric S. Raymond no longer the maintainer?
He has abandoned updating the file with modern updates, and personal posts on his blog show that he is not the best person to represent hackers. 
- He is not the original owner and felt obligated to defend his actions. http://www.catb.org/jargon/jargtxt.html
- When he took control of the file he deleted many of the original entries and re-wrote others.
- He has posted hateful speech towards transexuals, which is against the spirit of modern day hacker culture. (http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5015)
- Horribly racist rants calling african americans and non-white subhuman. (http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5001)
# I welcome all pull requests and hope that today will start a new beginning for the jargon file.
